Before you start: organizing your files
============================================

Documentation of a dataset will be most efficient if you
organize your data and other files properly. We recommend that, before
anything else, you create the necessary directories as follows:

+------------+--------------+------------------------------------------+
|.. image:: media/Page2.png |- Create a directory for the survey.      |
|                           |  We suggest you name it using the        |
|                           |  country, survey’s year and the          |
|                           |  abbreviated name, e.g. “UGA_2018_HIES”  |
|                           |  for “Household Income and Expenditure   | 
|                           |  Survey” of Uganda collected in 2018.    |
+                           +------------------------------------------+
|                           |- Create various sub-directories for the. |
|                           |  data files (and for the various versions|
|                           |  of the dataset if relevant)             |
|                           +------------------------------------------+
|                           |- Create sub-directories for the          |
|                           |  documentation and for the program files |
|                           |  if relevant (see example).              |
