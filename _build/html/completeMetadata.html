<h1>7. Completing metadata<a class="headerlink" href="#completing-metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Metadata Editor makes use of the Data Documentation Initiative
(DDI Version 2.5), the Dublin Core (DCMI version X) metadata standards
and ISO 19139 for geospatial information.</p>
<p>The table below provides an overview of the different metadata standards
as related to the project. Each metadata standard is integrated into the
template that will define the project.</p>
<img alt="_images/Page23.png" src="_images/Page23.png" />
<p>A thorough completion of the DDI and DCMI elements will significantly
raise the value of the archiving work by providing users with the
necessary information to put the study into its proper context and to
understand its purpose.</p>
<p>The DDI requires completion of the following sections: Document
Description, Study Description, Datasets, Variables Groups, and
External Resources. Recommendations for each field included in the
IHSN template are provided below.</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />

<tbody>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>The IHSN recommends using the standardized IHSN DDI/DCMI templates

website to download the latest version of these templates,

<p><strong>Overall recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As an archivist, you may need to seek assistance from key experts
involved in some of the technical aspects of the survey.</p></li>
<li><p>As a general rule, avoid using ALL CAPS when you fill DDI fields.
Also, check the spelling of all entries. The Editor does not provide
(yet) an automatic spell checker.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the examples below present an optimal documentation of some
fields. In many cases, for past surveys, you will not find such
detailed information. Try to provide as much detail as possible. For
future surveys, the information should be compiled and provided
during the whole life cycle of the survey. This will ensure that the
best possible documentation is available at completion of that
survey.</p></li>

<p>Documenting a study using the DDI and DCMI metadata standards consists
of generating a metadata file which will be saved in XML format in what
is called an <em>XML Document</em>. The <em>Document Description</em> described below
is a description of that XML file. The IHSN Template selected 4 elements
to describe the DDI document.</p>

<p><em>Data entry was conducted by 12
data entry operators in tow
shifts, supervised by 2 data
entry supervisors, using a total
of 7 computers (6 data entry
computers plus one supervisors’
computer). All data entry was
conducted at the GenCenStat head
office using manual data entry.
For data entry, CSPro version
2.6.007 was used with a highly
structured data entry program,
using system controlled approach
that controlled entry of each
variable. All range checks and
skips were controlled by the
program and operators could not
override these. A limited set of
consistency checks were also
included in the data entry
program. In addition, the
calculation of anthropometric
Z-scores was also included in the
data entry programs for use
during analysis. Open-ended
responses (“Other” answers) were
not entered or coded, except in
rare circumstances where the
response matched an existing code
in the questionnaire.</em></p>
<p><em>Structure and completeness
checking ensured that all
questionnaires for the cluster
had been entered, were
structurally sound, and that
women’s and children’s
questionnaires existed for each
eligible woman and child.</em></p>
<p><em>100% verification of all
variables was performed using
independent verification, i.e.
double entry of data, with
separate comparison of data
followed by modification of one
or both datasets to correct
keying errors by original
operators who first keyed the
files.</em></p>
<p><em>After completion of all
processing in CSPro, all
individual cluster files were
backed up before concatenating
data together using the CSPro
file concatenate utility.</em></p>
<p><em>For tabulation and analysis SPSS
versions 10.0 and 14.0 were used.
Version 10.0 was originally used
for all tabulation programs,
except for child mortality. Later
version 14.0 was used for child
mortality, data quality
tabulations and other analysis
activities.</em></p>
<p><em>After transferring all files to
SPSS, certain variables were
recoded for use as background
characteristics in the tabulation
of the data, including grouping
age, education, geographic areas
as needed for analysis. In the
process of recoding ages and
dates some random imputation of
dates (within calculated
constraints) was performed to
handle missing or “don’t know”
ages or dates. Additionally, a
wealth (asset) index of household
members was calculated using
principal components analysis,
based on household assets, and
both the score and quintiles were
included in the datasets for use
in tabulations.</em></p>

errors: 1) non-sampling errors
and 2) sampling errors.
Non-sampling errors are the
results of mistakes made in the
implementation of data collection

efforts were made during
implementation of the 2005-2006
MICS to minimize this type of
error, however, non-sampling
errors are impossible to avoid
and difficult to evaluate
statistically.</em></p>
<p><em>If the sample of respondents had
been a simple random sample, it
would have been possible to use
straightforward formulae for
calculating sampling errors.
However, the 2005-2006 MICS
sample is the result of a
multi-stage stratified design,
and consequently needs to use
more complex formulae. The SPSS
complex samples module has been
used to calculate sampling errors
for the 2005-2006 MICS. This
module uses the Taylor
linearization method of variance
estimation for survey estimates
that are means or proportions.
This method is documented in the
SPSS file CSDescriptives.pdf
found under the Help, Algorithms
options in SPSS.</em></p>
<p><em>Sampling errors have been
calculated for a select set of
statistics (all of which are
proportions due to the
limitations of the Taylor
linearization method) for the
national sample, urban and rural
areas, and for each of the five
regions. For each statistic, the
estimate, its standard error, the
coefficient of variation (or
relative error – the ratio
between the standard error and
the estimate), the design effect,
and the square root design effect
(DEFT – the ratio between the
standard error using the given
sample design and the standard
error that would result if a
simple random sample had been
used), as well as the 95 percent
confidence intervals (+/-2
standard errors).</em></p>
